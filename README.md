# Workday Scheduler

## Description

This is the fifth assignment from the UConn Coding Bootcamp curriculum which combines our working knowledge of the first four week's topics (Git, Terminal, HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, GitLab, Web Accessibility, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Web APIs and jQuery) with the fifth week's topic: Third-Party APIs. 

For this assignment we were to build a work day scheduler, or daily planner, by modifying some starter code. 

## Goals

- Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.
- This app with run in the browser and feature dnamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
- Will utilize a library like [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to work with dates and times. 
    - If decide not to use Moment.js library, could utilize alternative libraries such as the following: [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/), [Day.js](https://day.js.org/), [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), or [js-Joda](https://js-joda.github.io/js-joda/).
- Application loads with no errors.
- Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Application user interface style is clean and polished.
- Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc. 

## Instructions

Our instructions for this assignment were based on the following user story and acceptance criteria: 

### User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
#### Definitions

*Third Party APIs:* Third party APIs are located on third party servers. Third party APIs are APIs provided by third parties — generally companies such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google — to allow you to access their functionality via JavaScript and use it on your site. To access them from JavaScript you first need to connect to the API functionality and make it available on your page. This typically involves first linking to a JavaScript library available on the server via a <script> element,

*standard business hours:* In the U.S., a business whose employees work Monday through Friday 9am to 5pm; this results in an 8 hour workday and a typical work-week of 40 hours. 

*local storage:* A JavaScript read-only property that allows you to access a storage object for the document's origin; the data stored is saved across browser sessions. Data stored in localStorage has no expiration time (data is not cleared when the page session ends, or closes). Data stored in localStorage is specific to the protocol of the page.
